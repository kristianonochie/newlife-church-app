  {'date': '2026-02-01', 'title': 'The Month of Love Begins', 'scripture': '1 John 4:19', 'body': 'We love because he first loved us.\n\nFebruary started with a reminder: all love flows from God\'s love. Anna realized her capacity to love others was rooted in experiencing God\'s love first. That foundation changed everything about how she approached relationships.\n\nThis simple verse contains profound theology. Love isn\'t something you generate; it\'s something you respond to. Your capacity to love others flows directly from experiencing God\'s love for you. If you struggle to love others, don\'t focus on trying harder; deepen your experience of being loved by God. When you truly grasp how much God loves you—unconditionally, sacrificially, eternally—your love for others naturally increases. This love is responsive, not compulsive. It\'s gratitude expressed through generosity. You love because you\'ve first been loved. This is the only sustainable foundation for genuine love.', 'thoughts': 'Your love for others is a reflection of God\'s love for you. How does that change your perspective?', 'action': 'Tell someone today that God loves them—and that you do too.', 'confession': 'Thank You for loving me first. Help me to love others from that overflow. Amen.', 'author': 'NLCC'},
  {'date': '2026-02-02', 'title': 'Candlemas: Light in Darkness', 'scripture': 'John 8:12', 'body': 'When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."\n\nOn Candlemas, Ben reflected on how Jesus is the light. In his darkest times, he\'d felt lost. But following Jesus meant never walking in darkness alone. The light of His presence guided every step.\n\nDarkness is real—depression, fear, confusion, despair. In those seasons, this promise is revolutionary. Jesus isn\'t just a light among many; He is the light. The source. Following Him means you\'re never walking in absolute darkness. You have illumination. This doesn\'t mean all questions are answered or all fear removed. It means you\'re never alone or abandoned in darkness. His light penetrates. His presence guides. His truth clarifies. When darkness feels overwhelming, remember you\'re never walking it alone. His light is available. This light is called "the light of life"—not just illumination but life itself. Following Jesus into light means following into fullness of living.', 'thoughts': 'Jesus is your light. In what darkness do you need His illumination?', 'action': 'Light a candle today. Let it remind you of Jesus\' light in your life.', 'confession': 'Jesus, be my light. Guide me from darkness into Your presence. Amen.', 'author': 'NLCC'},
  {'date': '2026-02-28', 'title': 'The Completion of February', 'scripture': 'Psalm 30:5', 'body': 'For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.\n\nCatalina reviewed February. The month had struggles but also God\'s faithfulness. Weeping had come, but so had rejoicing. As February ended, she anticipated March with hope, knowing God\'s favor lasted beyond any night of tears.\n\nThis verse contains eternal hope. Suffering is temporary. God\'s favor is permanent. Difficult seasons end. Joy returns. This isn\'t denial of current pain, but confidence in its temporary nature. The longest night eventually gives way to morning. Winter eventually yields to spring. Despair eventually breaks to hope. God\'s favor isn\'t earned by good behavior; it\'s based on His nature. He\'s favorable. He\'s kind. He\'s committed. When you\'re in the night season—weeping, struggling, suffering—remember: morning comes. His favor never left. Hold on. The season will change. Rejoicing returns. Every night is temporary in God\'s kingdom.', 'thoughts': 'Every night of tears has a morning of rejoicing. God\'s favor outlasts all sorrow.', 'action': 'Thank God for February\'s lessons. Welcome March with hope.', 'confession': 'Thank You for seeing me through February. Your favor lasts. I rejoice. Amen.', 'author': 'NLCC'},

  {'date': '2026-07-31', 'title': 'The Completion of July', 'scripture': 'Psalm 136:1', 'body': 'Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.\n\nTaylor reviewed July. Halfway through the year. Challenges and victories, growth and struggle, God\'s faithfulness throughout. She gave thanks. Her heart was renewed. As July ended, she stepped into August with gratitude and trust.\n\nEvery month brings growth. Look back with gratitude. Thank God for lessons learned. Look forward with hope. God\'s love endures forever, through every month and season.', 'thoughts': 'Give thanks for where you\'ve been. Anticipate where you\'re going.', 'action': 'Thank God for July. Welcome August with faith.', 'confession': 'Thank You for Your faithfulness. Your love endures forever. Amen.', 'author': 'NLCC'},
