His family gave up—except his mother. She never stopped loving him, praying for him, believing God would restore him. Year after year of disappointment. But she persevered. One day Marcus woke up. The love that never quit had finally broken through his hardness. His mother\\'s perseverance had literally saved his life.\\n\\nPaul teaches that love is a choice to persevere. Not sentimental feelings that fade when difficulty comes. Real love is a commitment to continue hoping, believing, and serving even when circumstances suggest giving up is the wisest choice.
